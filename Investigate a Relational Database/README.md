# Investigate a Relational Database
## Overview
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

## Introduction
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the DVD Rental database is provided below.

## Templates for Project Submissions
### Presentations
You are now on the portion of the project you will need to submit to a reviewer. To pass this project follow the instructions below to create a presentation. You will submit a zip file with two items:

- Slide Deck (4 slides)
- Text File with SQL queries

Your presentation should include:

- Four slides
- One question on each slide
- One visualization (graph / chart / table) per slide
- A 1-2 sentence answer to the question, based on the data and visualization, on each slide
- Indicate which code in the attached text file was used to create the visualization OR add the query used to generate the visualization.

###     Visualizations

You should have four slides that are similar to the Submission Slide Example below. Remember:

The questions you ask are up to you.
- All four of your final submitted queries should contain a JOIN and AGGREGATION.
- At least two of your final submitted queries should contain either a subquery OR a CTE.
- At least one of your final submitted queries should contain a Window Function.
- At least one column generated by the Window Function should be included in one of your final visualization.

## Solution
- Presentation Deck - SQL Project>SQL Project Abdulwaiu Tiamiyu.pdf
- Query for each of the slide - SQL Project>Queries.txt
